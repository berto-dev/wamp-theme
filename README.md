Not use www folder for your site/app. This version of theme is directly for connect an external folder via an alias.

1 - Move your project out of www

2 - Backup your wamp classic empty www folder

3 - Change your www whit this themifized version

4 - www it's now only fo localhost projects list so...<br>
    Connect the new project location (project per project) in new alias, exemple:<br>
    ex version no alias-> www/mysite01/<br>
    to -> c:/myproject/mysite01<br>
